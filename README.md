# Programing-Methods-Labs
These labs was done during my second term at UWr.

All labs were written in Racket.

Praca_projektowa_2 is a logic gate simulator. The folder with logic gate simulator contains also some testing circuits like adder or multiplexer.
The last one is a simple language interpreter. The language contains mutable list and variables, mathematical operations, functions and operating instructions.
